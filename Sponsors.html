        <h4> We are thrilled to announce that Robocracy had an amazing and award
          winning time at the 2018-2019 Hudson Valley NY Red Hook Qualifying
          FIRST Tech Challenge Tournament. As a Finalist Alliance Captain,
          Robocracy 9773 will be one of the five teams advancing to the Regional
          Championship to be held on Sunday, February 10th. In addition to
          advancing at the tournament, Robocracy was chosen first runner up for
          the Think Award. This is given to a team that best reflects the
          journey a team takes as they experience the engineering design process
          during the build season. Robocracy was also awarded the coveted
          Inspire Award, which is the highest award given to a team who has
          proven to the judges that they are strong ambassadors for FIRST
          programs and a role model for other teams. We invite you to join us in
          celebrating these accomplishments. Because of your sponsorship and
          your ability to support us, we have come this far. If you would like
          to further donate to our future, please follow us on Facebook (FTC

          festive time of year, and we look forward to sharing with you many
          more robotic successes. </h4>
