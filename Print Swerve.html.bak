      <h1>A Primer on FIRST LEGO League (FLL) </h1>
      <h2> Objectives </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Using LEGO Mindstorms robotics as a hook to entice children to start
          a journey in practicing STEM and teamwork. For kids age 9-14. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2> Activities </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A team builds and programs a LEGO Mindstorms robot customized to
          perform a set of missions. A new game is released each year in August.
          Each mission is worth some points, and the ultimate goal is to score
          as many points as possible in two and a half minutes. </li>
        <li>A team works on solving a real-life problem of their choosing on the
          topic of the year. The project typically follows well established
          phases: first selecting a problem that speaks to the team, then
          working toward a solution, and then presenting their solutions to
          interested audiences.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2> Results </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>For many children, this is the first time that they will participate
          in a long-term project, as the season typically stretches from
          September to February. They will learn a lot, both in terms of
          robotics, programing, as well as team-working skills. They will
          develop valuable presentation skills as each team gets a chance to
          present their work (robot, project, teamwork) to a set of encouraging
          judges at a regional competition. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2> Mechanics </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A team consists of up to 10 children and at least 2 adult mentors.
          For a first season, we recommend starting with a core of 4-6 children.
        </li>
        <li>A team typically meet for 2-3 hours per week. Toward the end of the
          season, some add one more meeting as the competition date nears.</li>
        <li>Mentors do not need to be overly technical; helping the kids with
          soft skills is probably the most important contributions from the
          mentors. We would recommend that one adult learns how to program the
          robots to be able to provide guidance to the children if the robot
          does not perform as expected. In general, we have found that each of
          the parents in a team can contribute valuable skills, from
          presentation skills, time management, programming, building,
          technical.</li>
        <li>We recommend using the LEGO EV3 Mindstorms as a base; having two is
          recommended to help teammates compare distinct solutions based on
          performance rather than opinion. An EV3 costs about $400 and will be
          reused from year to year. Registering a team costs about $300 per
          season.</li>
        <li>A team can meet in a living room or basement: the largest item is a
          4x8 foot table on which all of the missions for the robot are placed.
          Building a table is relatively simple, and you may be able to inherit
          one from a local team. One or two computers (Mac or Windows) will be
          used to program the robots.</li>
        <li>Team members learn how to effectively work as a team, because just
          like in real life, STEM is a team sports. FIRST suggests a set of
          guidelines that encourages cooperation, respect, and mentoring.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2> We love to help </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>For children living in the Westchester, NY area, we are organizing a
          summer camp (link) one a year, typically one of the last weeks of
          August. This is a great way to checkout if this is something that your
          child is interested in, and we will teach them a lot of robotics
          skills while solving a set of fun challenges. </li>
        <li>Whether you live near or far, feel free to contact us
          (ftcrobocracy@gmail.com). We are happy to help you start on this fun
          and rewarding journey.</li>
