      <h1>Recycle for Good: Laptops for Schools and Orphanages </h1>
      <h5> Team Robocracy is accepting donations of old laptops which, after
        refurbishing, will be donated to schools in need in order to promote
        access to technology. We are currently working with 2 sites on
        Hispaniola, one in the Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic and one in
        the French-Creole-speaking Haiti. Last year, we worked with an orphanage
        in India. We personally know people on the ground and are providing
        sustained technical support. </h5>
      <h2>Dominican Republic</h2>
      <p> We are partnering with El Colegio Adventista de la Fe, a modest K-6
        private primary school in one of the poorest working class areas of the
        capital of Santo Domingo. Despite its limited resources, the school
        enjoys academic success and provides a safe haven for students. While
        the country has reached a basic literacy rate of about 80%, schools are
        still severely underfunded and even private schools struggle to offer
        any technology to their students. We are sending to the DR laptops
        loaded with books in Spanish and English as well as educational games to
        promote literacy, math and science skills. The school staff is eager to
        use the 6 donated laptops to create a small computer lab. </p>

      <h2>Haiti</h2>
      <p> We are partnering with “La Joie de Vivre” orphanage in Arcahaie. A
        volunteer told us that the situation is so dire that many orphans have
        living relatives who cannot care for them until they become of working
        age, at which point they are often reclaimed by their families to help
        making a living for the family. The orphanage provides for and educates
        24 kids, and teaches many more in the neighborhood by offering free
        lunches. Presently, they have no computers. </p>

      <p> We are sending to Haiti laptops loaded with French and English books
        as well as educational software. Because of the lack of power and
        expensive gas (2 days at minimum wage pays for 1 gallon), generators are
        sparingly used. A significant expense of ours is refurbishing the laptop
        batteries so that the laptops may still be used when the generators are
        off. </p>
      <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
      <p> You can donate your old laptops, as we are identifying more schools
        that would benefit from our program. We are also accepting monetary
        donations to help cover the $60 that we spend, on average, to refurbish
        a used laptop. <br>
        <br>
        As a token of appreciation, we are gifting a USB light powered by a
        recycled battery (most broken laptop batteries have many working cells,
        which we reuse in these lights) for a contribution of $10 or more. </p>
      <h3> Practical Details </h3>

          <li>Please provide all recovery disks and Windows license
            documentation so that the original OS can be legally reinstalled.</li>
          <li>All laptops will be securely wiped of all data - and then a new

            software to securely destroy data to DoD (Dept of Defense)
            standards. More information on DBAN can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darik%27s_Boot_and_Nuke">here</a>.</li>

        <li>Apple laptops:</li>

          <li>We require the donor to remove the Mac from their iTunes account
            (AppleID) as well as log-off from all the apps before donating</li>
          <li>We are unable to accept Macs with forgotten AppleID passwords
            (since the donor cannot relinquish the Mac from their account)</li>
          <li>We will follow Apple recommended procedure for removing data and
            reinstalling the OS as listed here.</li>
