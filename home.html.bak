                      <center>We are a friend-based FIRST Tech Challenge
                        robotics team in Northern Westchester, NY. We were
                        founded in 2015 by FLL veterans who wanted to continue
                        having fun in FIRST after FLL. We had a successful
                        rookie year in the 2015-16 FIRST Res-Q season, and then
                        made it to the World Championship in the 2016-17
                        Velocity Vortex season. We were Hudson Valley Champions
                        for the 2017-2018 Relic Recovery season! We had a good
                        start this 2018-2019 Rover Ruckus, meeting the working
                        robot in 36 hour challenge, and winning the Inspire
                        award and our robot making it to the finals at our first
                        Red Hook FTC Qualifier! THIS YEARS INFO. As a team, we
                        are much more than building a winning competitive robot.
                        We also strive to foster STEM in our neighboring
                        community, especially undeserved school districts, so
                        that kids like us of all backgrounds can also enjoy the
                        rewarding experience that FIRST and other STEM
                        activities brings.</center>
