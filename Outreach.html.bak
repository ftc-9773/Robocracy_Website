          <p> The decision to help Traphagen Elementary start a robotics program
            came from a recent one-day STEM Expo, when more than 60 kids from
            grades 3 through 6 came to the school on a Saturday afternoon to
            participate. The administration was overjoyed at the turnout and
            have pledged to raise funding for 1 EV3 kit from their PTA
            organization. </p>

            volunteer to set up and mentor these eager 4th graders. The funding

            building and programing robots to about 2 dozen kids in each
            program. In addition to the LEGO Mindstorm robots, we were able to
            procure additional laptops for the program through a generous

          <h2> The 3rd Annual Robocracy Robotics Summer Workshop </h2>
          <h3> August 27th – August 31, 2018 </h3>
          <p> We came together for another summer to organize and fully
            participate in our third annual, week-long summer robotics workshop
            to introduce students in grades 2nd through 12th to STEM and
            robotics. For grades 2 through 7, we offered a week of robotics fun
            based on the LEGO Mindstorms. We used a game-based approach to teach
            solid robotics foundations, engage kids to build robots for many fun
            missions, and taught visual-programming skills to control the
            robots. For grades 7 through 12, we offered a new course titled
            Mastering Advanced Robotics &amp; Intro to FTC. Participants in this
            program built larger robots using aluminum structural parts,
            powerful motors, servos and their own creativity. Using a kit,
            students built an 18” by 18” robot of their own design to perform a
            competitive game played by 2 or more robots. All of the robots’
            actions were programmed by the students using Java on Android
            Studio. </p>

          <h2> Mercy College Saturday STEM Academy </h2>
          <h3> April 21 - May 12, 2018 </h3>
          <p> Previously taught only by professors and adult educators, our team
            was invited by Mercy College to teach a class at their Saturday STEM
            Academy. Being passionate about robots, and having the experience of
            building and programming, our team felt ready to handle this new
            endeavor. Using our knowledge of previous workshops, we designed a
            curriculum that incorporated both fun and learning. Our class
            included students who were new to robots and some with advanced
            knowledge. Those who were new were first taught to program robots to
            follow a line while more advanced students attached appendages to
            robots that would execute more difficult tasks. Over the 4 weeks
            that the class was held, students became more confident in their
            abilities and their knowledge of robotics and STEM. </p>

            spirit, so many exciting projects, and the FLL robots have gotten so
            much better. Congrats, we were very impressed. Robocracy kids took
            charge of the tournament like never before: they opened the ceremony
            with addresses from Christine Ackerman, our district superintendent,
            and Lisa Katz, our town's Deputy Supervisor, they refereed all the
            games, MCed the whole day, took pictures, and demoed our FTC robot.

            workshop to introduce young kids to STEM and robotics and share our
            passion. Each day we had a different challenge, racing bots,
            line-following bots, string bots, and of course the favorite
            sumobot! The kids said they couldn't wait to come back each day.
            Most of the kids who participated went on to join or form their own
            teams. We also recruited a new team member for our own team. </p>

            with them. They were very creative with the attachments they built.
            Several were interested in getting more involved in the FIRST Lego

            their own sumo-bot and letting them drive the robot. We also
            scrimmaged with the Jellyfish and the Techno Chicks who were also
            participating. There was a lot of interest in getting involved with
            the FIRST program at all levels, joining a team or starting new
            teams. We were also able to generate interest in our summer robotics

          <h3> January 21st, 2017 </h3>
          <p> Fifteen teams in the town of Chappaqua alone were inspired by the
            outreach and achievements of our FTC Robocracy team and the FLL
            Robobenders team that preceded it. Our team decided to organize
            Chappaqua's very own FIRST Lego League and Jr. FLL Tournament to
            support the growth of FIRST and STEM activities and foster a
            friendly culture of creative robotics in the community. One of our
            goals is for this event to be a FIRST and STEM Festival. We included
            an exhibition of our winning FTC competition robot for the kids to
            explore and drive around. Our team prepared for months, even making
            our own competition tables from scratch. It was a real treat to run
            and ref the tournament ourselves. We have a new respect for and
            insight into the role of the refs and judges at our own tournaments.
