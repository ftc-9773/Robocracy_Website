      <h2> The Art of Lego Robotics and Introduction to FLL </h2>
      <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the younger kids (2-7th grades), we will
        offer a week of robotics fun based on the LEGO Mindstorms. We use a
        game-based approach to teach solid robotics foundations, engaging kids
        to build robots for many fun missions and teaching visual-programming
        skills to control the robots. Children will use motors and sensors to
        perform robotic tasks, such as follow a line, detect other robots, knock
        down balls, and more. We will introduce many STEM concepts relevant to
        robotics, such as gear ratios, speed/power trade-offs, center of
        gravity, and PID control systems. Many children who participate in this
        robotics workshop, join a team themselves and we will do our best to
        help parents find a suitable team for any interested child. </p>
      <h2> Mastering Advanced Robotics and Introduction to FTC </h2>
      <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our advanced robotics workshop for 7-12th
        graders. Participants will build larger robots using aluminum structural
        parts, powerful motors, servos and their own creativity. Using a kit,
        students will build an 18” by 18” robot of their own design to perform a
        competitive game played by 2 or more robots. All of the robot actions
        are programmed by the students using Java on Android Studio. The games
        are played using wireless connected game pads. This class is a great way
        to launch any interested kids in the exciting world of 7-12th grade
        competitive FTC robotics. </p>
