      <h1>FTC Print Swerve</h1>
      <p> As an FTC team we always strive to push the competition to the next
        level. We have spent over a year developing our very own swerve drive to
        be a viable FTC drive base. After so much time and effort spent in
        development, we have developed the very first fully 3d printable Swerve
        drive viable for FTC. Finally we have gotten this competition tested
        design to a stage of completion. Therefore, we are releasing this design
        for the benefit of the FTC community. </p>
      <p>We provide here, everything you need to make your very own PRINT
        Swerve. This innovative swerve drive is entirely build out of 3D printed
        parts, and other COTS components. It uses high quality gears for
        unprecedented reliability. We use a novel “Tower” design where the drive
        motor is directly mounted on top of the drive to deliver the compact
        footprint needed for FTC robots. To our knowledge, this is the first 3D
        printable, nearly-indestructible integrated swerve drive, optimized for
        FTC use. </p>
      <p>UPDATE: It has been brought to our attention that the necessary 1/2"
        thunderhex flanged bearings are currently unavailable. You can instead
        use the equivalent radial bearings (1/2" thunderhex radial bearings)
        with the Tube Body Radial Bearings.stl part. The necessary replacement
        part is available on here, or by following the link below. </p>
