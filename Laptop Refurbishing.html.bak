      <h1>Recycle for Good: Laptops for Schools and Orphanages </h1>
      <h5> Team Robocracy is accepting donations of old laptops which, after
        refurbishing, will be donated to schools in need in order to promote
        access to technology. We are currently working with 2 sites on
        Hispaniola, one in the Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic and one in
        the French-Creole-speaking Haiti. Last year, we worked with an orphanage
        in India. We personally know people on the ground and are providing
        sustained technical support. </h5>
      <h2>Dominican Republic</h2>
      <p> We are partnering with El Colegio Adventista de la Fe, a modest K-6
        private primary school in one of the poorest working class areas of the
        capital of Santo Domingo. Despite its limited resources, the school
        enjoys academic success and provides a safe haven for students. While
        the country has reached a basic literacy rate of about 80%, schools are
        still severely underfunded and even private schools struggle to offer
        any technology to their students. We are sending to the DR laptops
        loaded with books in Spanish and English as well as educational games to
        promote literacy, math and science skills. The school staff is eager to
        use the 6 donated laptops to create a small computer lab. </p>

      <h2>Haiti</h2>
      <p> We are partnering with “La Joie de Vivre” orphanage in Arcahaie. A
        volunteer told us that the situation is so dire that many orphans have
        living relatives who cannot care for them until they become of working
        age, at which point they are often reclaimed by their families to help
        making a living for the family. The orphanage provides for and educates
        24 kids, and teaches many more in the neighborhood by offering free
        lunches. Presently, they have no computers. </p>

      <p> We are sending to Haiti laptops loaded with French and English books
        as well as educational software. Because of the lack of power and
        expensive gas (2 days at minimum wage pays for 1 gallon), generators are
        sparingly used. A significant expense of ours is refurbishing the laptop
        batteries so that the laptops may still be used when the generators are
        off. </p>
      <h2>Part C: Share your own Github version of the ftc_app with your
        teammates </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to your team's GitHub web page, typically
          "https://github.com/your-account-name/your-repository-name", click the
          clone or download button, and select "Download ZIP" </li>
        <br>
        <li>Create a directory where you want to have the code on your machine</li>
        <br>
        <li>Move the downloaded directory in the newly created directory</li>
        <br>
        <li>Open Android Studio. If you have never opened it before, the first
          page will invite you to "Import Project." If you have used Android
          studio before, click on the "File-&gt;New-&gt;Import Project". You
          then locate your fct_app-master folder in the folder navigator and hit
          "OK."</li>
        <br>
        <li>In the bottom right corner, an warning will pop up: "Unregistered
          VCS root detected". Extend the message and click on "Add Root."<br>
